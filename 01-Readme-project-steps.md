## Project steps

### Step 1: Setup

Start by setting up your development environment. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can install Vite globally using the following command:

``` bash
npm install -g create-vite
````


### Step 2: Initialize the Project

Create a new Vite project using the following command:

``` bash
create-vite wms-app
```

Navigate into the project directory:

`cd wms-app`


### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
npm install react react-dom react-router-dom firebase
```


### Step 4: Set Up Firebase

Create a new Firebase project and set up the Firestore database. You'll need to obtain the Firebase configuration object, including the API keys and project details.


### Step 5: Project Structure

Organize your project files into meaningful directories. For example:

- src
  - components
  - pages
  - services
  - utils


### Step 6: Create React Components

Inside the components directory, create reusable components such as Header, Sidebar, InventoryTable, OrderForm, etc. These components will be used across different pages.


### Step 7: Create Pages

Inside the pages directory, create pages like Dashboard, Inventory, Orders, etc. Each page will be responsible for displaying specific information and using the relevant components.


### Step 8: Implement Routing

Set up routing using react-router-dom to navigate between different pages. Define routes in your App.js or index.js file.


### Step 9: Connect to Firebase

Create a Firebase service file (firebase.js) inside the services directory. Import the necessary Firebase modules and initialize Firebase using your Firebase configuration object. You can then use Firebase's Firestore to perform database operations such as retrieving and updating data.


### Step 10: Integrate Firestore

Inside your components or pages, utilize the Firebase service to interact with Firestore. Implement functions for fetching data, updating inventory, creating orders, etc. Make use of Firebase's Firestore API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.


### Step 11: Styling

Apply CSS styles to your components and pages to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. You can use CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or CSS modules for modular styling.


### Step 12: Testing and Deployment

Test your WMS application thoroughly and fix any bugs or issues. Once you're satisfied with the functionality, you can deploy your application to a hosting service like Firebase Hosting or Netlify.
